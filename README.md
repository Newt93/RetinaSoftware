# RetinaSoftware
NOTE: You need a high powered camera that can take pictures of a retina or a picture of a retina (testing) to make this work.

If you have a camera that can take pictures of a retina, you could feed the pictures it takes into this program to be "authorized" or "unauthorized"

This is a work in progress and my code may not be 100% accurate, this was to learn how the retinal images can be processed with OpenCV then classified using a CNN. I am currently working on the CNN more.
